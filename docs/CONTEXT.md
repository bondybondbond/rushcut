## PIVOT — LOCAL BUILD (decided end of Batch 7)

**Root cause:** 30 Mbps upload -> 1.9 GB clip = ~8 min upload; 19 GB session = ~84 min. Unusable.
**New model:** Pipeline runs locally via WSL2. No uploads. No Lambda. Browser UI unchanged.
**Full pivot spec:** See `CLAUDE.md` -> "MAJOR PIVOT" section at the top.

## Current Phase

**Phase 2 — Batch 11c (UX Polish Round 2) COMPLETE**

Batch 11c delivered: home screen two-card redesign with real project thumbnails, mandatory project name modal, scan spinner, AppShell (fixed NavDrawer), transition picker (None/Crossfade/Dip), elapsed count-up timer on Output, Open File button, always-red bin icons, CardBlock bins in timeline, xfade duration clamped to prevent short clip consumption. E2E eval: 41/41 PASS.

---

## Immediate Next Task

**Batch 12** — delete project from Library, audio sample rate normalisation (force `-ar 48000`), stale job cleanup, music volume slider, or **Director Intelligence** (Gemini clip ordering, beat-sync, motion peak trimming).

Priority: Director Intelligence (differentiating AI layer) or the three quality-of-life fixes that affect all renders (audio rate, stale jobs, delete project).

## Recently Completed

**Batch 11c — UX Polish Round 2 (2026-03-27)**

- Home screen: two-card layout (Start New Project + Resume a Project), real thumbnails from `first_clip_thumbnail` (Rust subquery added to `list_projects`), dates in Resume section
- Mandatory project name modal before `create_project` is called; Skip button removed
- Scan spinner overlay during `scanning` state
- AppShell: shared `<AppShell>` wrapper with fixed NavDrawer; removed per-page NavDrawer inline usage
- Transition picker: None (default) / Crossfade / Dip to black; `DEFAULT_CONFIG.transition = "none"`
- `XFADE_DUR` increased to 1.5s; clamped to `min(1.5, min_clip_dur / 2.0)` to prevent short clip consumption
- Output page: elapsed count-up timer replacing static copy; "Starting up the magic..." initial stage; "My Projects" button top-right; project name displayed as `{name}.mp4`
- Open File button on Output done state (Rust `open_output_path` command using `explorer /select,`)
- Always-red bin icons in ClipList and timeline; CardBlock bins; card delete bins in SettingsPanel headers
- `#C5FFF9` Back buttons on Upload/Editor/Library; `#E1F2CE` My Projects button on Output
- E2E eval: 41/41 PASS (0 failures)

**Batch 11b — E2E Infrastructure + Eval Skill (2026-03-26)**

- WebdriverIO v9 + msedgedriver E2E scaffold; 3-layer BiDi fix; `rushcut-eval` skill; 33/35 PASS

## Deferred / Blocked

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Boring clip filter (motion score) | Batch 12+ |
| Smart clip selection (>20 clips) | Batch 12+ |
| Per-clip in/out handles | Batch 12+ |
| Proxy files for HEVC scrubbing | Batch 13+ (interactive timeline) |
| Auth / project library | Batch 12+ |
| Stripe / paid tier | Phase 3 |
| Cloud mode (Vercel + Lambda) | Phase 3 |

## Key Decisions Since Phase 1

- **DEC-018:** Phase 2 gate = founder's own successful 60+ clip session (not paying users)
- **DEC-019:** Competitor research = web-only (desktop apps have different capability/latency profile)
- **DEC-020:** Stripe deferred until AI layer exists — charging for clip stitching has no lock-in
- **DEC-021:** "In the middle" positioning confirmed — direction power, not full auto-AI, not manual timeline
- **DEC-022:** Full local build — upload bottleneck (84 min for 19 GB session at 30 Mbps) makes cloud-upload model unworkable for real sessions. Phase 2 runs entirely on-machine via WSL2.

## Live Infra State

- **Vercel:** Still deployed (git-main URL), but not the active dev target for Phase 2
- **Lambda:** Idle — retired as processing backend. Do not delete.
- **Supabase:** PAUSED — data preserved, restorable within 90 days. Not used in Phase 2.
- **R2:** DELETED — bucket emptied and removed.
- **Lambda / ECR:** DELETED — do not rebuild.
- **Local FFmpeg:** WSL2 Ubuntu-24.04, `/usr/bin/ffmpeg` (v6.1.1) — installed via `apt-get install -y --fix-missing ffmpeg`
- **SQLite:** `%APPDATA%\rushcut\rushcut.db` — created on first `pnpm dev`
